This Flutter News App leverages the powerful GetX state management framework to deliver a seamless and responsive news reading experience. The app consists of three main pages:

**Home Screen:** 
This page features trending news categories, including sections for Crypto, Apple, and Wall Street Journal news. Users can easily access the latest and most popular articles at a glance.

**Customized News Page:** This page allows users to tailor their news feed according to their interests. It includes a robust search option, enabling users to find articles based on specific keywords or topics.

**News Details Page:** Each news article has a dedicated page providing detailed information. Additionally, this page includes a Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature that reads the news aloud in English, enhancing accessibility and convenience.

The use of GetX ensures efficient state management, offering smooth navigation and real-time updates across the app.
